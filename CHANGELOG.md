# Change Log

Whenever a new version is created, add the new branch name and the changes here

## [v1.0.0]

- Initial soft release with news article

## [v1.0.1]

- Move setup commands from `coderoad.yaml` to `setup.sh`
- Add creation of `.bash_history` in setup commands so CodeRoad watchers recognize it when the first command is entered
- Fine tune reset commands

## [v1.0.2]

- Restructure commits to use new style. Instead of loading a new test file, and commenting out the old one on each commit, this loads all the tests in the `INIT` commit and uses mocha settings to only run tests in a specific file. The commits now just change the test file that should run.
- There was an issue with the last commit not loading after using the reset button in a tutorial. I added a final commit at end that seems to have resolved it.
- Add hint for [issue on step 160](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/45521)

## [v1.0.3]

- Moved `touch` and `mkdir` commands to variables: `checkTouch` and `checkMkdir`
- Added a new check and variable for `mv` on `touch` and `mkdir` to account for renaming typos
- changed asserts in those lessons to `assert(checkTouch || checkMV);` or `assert(checkTouch || checkMV);`

## [v1.0.4]

- Remove part of test on 700, 720, 730, and 1450 to similarly (as v1.0.3) account for typos when renaming something

## [v2.0.0]

- Add Gitpod config
